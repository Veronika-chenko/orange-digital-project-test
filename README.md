# Digital Project Website

This project is a test task with the goal of creating an adaptive page based on the desktop FIGMA layout, using the SASS (SCSS) preprocessor.

## Features

- **Adaptability:** The website's design has been self-developed to dynamically adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring a user-friendly experience across desktops, mobile phones, and tablets.

- **SVG Sprite Graphics:** The power of SVG sprites has been harnessed to efficiently manage and display multiple graphics while minimizing HTTP requests. This approach contributes to quicker loading times and a smoother user experience.

- **Scroll Animations:** Scroll animations have been integrated to bring elements to life as users navigate through the content. These animations provide an engaging and interactive browsing experience.

- **Sass Integration:** The website's styles have been organized and enhanced using Sass, a powerful CSS preprocessor. This allows for more efficient styling, variable usage, and code reusability.

- **Mobile Menu Functionality:** A JavaScript-powered mobile menu enhances the website's navigation on smaller screens, ensuring a seamless experience for all users.

- **Swiper Sliders in Hero Section:** The Hero section features Swiper sliders, implemented with JavaScript, to showcase images that dynamically transition, creating an engaging introduction to the website.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** The foundation of the website's structure and content presentation.
- **CSS3:** Styling and layout control, including the implementation of adaptability for different devices.
- **Sass:** Utilized to streamline and optimize the website's styles, offering features like variables and nesting.
- **JavaScript:** Used for scroll animations, mobile menu functionality, and Swiper sliders.
- **SVG:** Utilized for creating vector graphics that remain sharp and clear at any resolution.
- **SVG Sprite:** A technique used to consolidate multiple SVG images into a single sprite, optimizing loading times.
